       <p> A Play, by definition is a form of literature written by a playwright, usually consisting of dialogue or singing between characters, intended for theatrical performance rather than just reading. On Broadway, a play is a show that does not include dancing or song.  </p>
       <p> A Musical is a form of theatrical performance that combines songs, spoken dialogue, acting and dance. Musicals do not always have dance, such as in Dear Evan Hansen or Come from Away, but many musicals cast with dance skill in mind as well. Musicals are the more common of the two on Broadway, but there are still many plays currently running in Broadway theaters. </p> </html>
