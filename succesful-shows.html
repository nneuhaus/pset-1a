  <h4> Pictured above are some of the posters of the longest running shows. </h4>

<p> The longer a show runs, the more succesful the show becomes. This is because more people are able to see the show and listen to the music, etc. However, even if a show does not have a long run, it can still be succesful. For example, "The Prom" and "The Cher Show" both ran for under a year on Broadway, but they are still very popular and well known. </p>
<p> There are also some upcoming shows that were succesful enough to transition to Broadway. An example of this is "Six," a musical based on King Henry's six wives. This musical was very anticipated, so a lot of tickets have already sold before the musical even came to Broadway.
